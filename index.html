                    <p>I have been programming games/tech demo's off and on since I started learning how to program(1998ish) using QBasic. As I entered the workforce as a programmer I started using XNA. Since XNA I have created 50+ tech demo's that went nowhere. The reason I have abandoned so many projects is motivation. Most of the time I don't know if my new game idea would be worth the time to complete, this thought is the death of most of my games.<br /><br />With the motivational help of my brother Ryan, I was able to finish my first game <a href='/web/20140516224432/http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/The-Return-of-CyberBox/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258550c29'>The Return of Cyberbox</a> to XBLIG.<br /><br />The other most polished(and my favourite) game is L.I.E.(Lost In Ethonia) which I have been releasing periodic alpha releases for a while now. <a href='/web/20140516224432/https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4348227/BarkerGames/LostInEthonia/LostInEthonia.zip'>Download Alpha</a><br />Recently I added a cool looking Parallax Effect to it which has sparked up my interest in it again.<br /><br />I would love to release L.I.E. and I think the best motivation to finish it I could get from you. <br /><br />You heard me right, YOU!<br /><br />You know what you like to play, right? So help me make a fun game by voting on the features for upcoming releases <a href='/web/20140516224432/https://trello.com/b/oqBz45TU/lost-in-ethonia'>here.</a> <br />Knowing that other people also think: it is fun/has potential, would greatly improve my motivation. Therefore finishing it sooner.<br />New ideas are also welcome(Email BarkerGames@gmail.com your cool ideas)<br />Don't like the game so far? Email me your concerns and I will do my best to make L.I.E. awesome.<br /><br />Will you help motivate me, and help L.I.E. evolve into a finished, awesome game?</p>
